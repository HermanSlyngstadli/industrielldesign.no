    <p>Kek (also spelled as Kuk or Keku) is the deification of the primordial concept of darkness in ancient Egyptian religion. In the Ogdoad cosmogony, his name meant darkness. As a concept, Kek was viewed as androgynous, his female form being known as Keket (also spelled as Kauket), which is simply the female form of the word Kek.[1][2][3]
        
    Like all four dualistic concepts in the Ogdoad, Kek's male form was depicted as a frog, or as a frog-headed man, and the female form as a snake, or a snake-headed woman. As a symbol of darkness, Kek also represented obscurity and the unknown, and thus chaos. Also, Kek was seen as that which occurred before light, thus was known as the bringer-in of light. The other members of the Ogdoad are Nu and Naunet, Amun and Amaunet, Huh and Hauhet.</p>
