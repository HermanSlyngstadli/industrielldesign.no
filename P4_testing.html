                        <p><br>The purpose with this questionnaire was to get a brief feedback on Leonardo's new website. 
                        The questionnaire contained a few questions on who the answerers were to have an idea wether they were the intended user group for the website or not.
                        The rest of the questions address wether they thought the site was user friendly and functional. We asked the users to enter the website before answering these questions. 
                        The tasks they got were not the most thorough once because unfortunately we were not able to prioritized enough time on user testing, however we believe we believe we got valuable information that can help us improve the webpage later.</p>

					<h2>Tester audience</h2>
					<p>
                        <p>To make sure the target audience answered the questionnaire, we asked our client, Leonardo linjeforening, to publish it on Leonardo linjeforening's private Facebook-page.
                        The group consists of current and former students at Industriell Design. We do want to have businesses and other students as audience to the website as well, however at this point we found it sufficient to concentrate on the main user group: students at Indusriell Design.
                        86 percent of the answerers were current students, the remaining 14 percent were former students, 11 percent employed, the rest uneployed. All of the answerers were between 18 and 40 years of age.
                        In addition we ran two live tests with students that did not study design and a couple more on design students.</p>

					<h2>Testing platforms</h2>
					<p>
                        <p>The majority of the respondents to the questionnaire used Google Chrome to visit the website. 17 percent used their smartphone, however we encouraged to try the site on different devices, either by opening the link on their phone if they had not done it already, or simply resize the window screen on their computer.</p>

					<h2>Feedback summary</h2>
					<p>
                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>According to the live user tests we did, the users did like the over all design and layout of the page. 
                        We did not go into details during the testings, and we did not get many concrete feedback on how to improve the layout.
                        The design students expressed that they liked the choice of colors because they represented Leonardo well. Another popular element was the fixed navigation bar that changes colors when scrolling away from the top of the page. 
                        The slider on the page for students however turned out maybe to be too big for some computer screens. Sometimes it was hard to see that the selected field popped up on the top of the slider.
                        In the questionnaire people commented that the website was "very cool".</p>
                        
                        <h3>Navigation</h3>
                        <p>The navigation bar is similar on all of the pages except for the index-page. The participants to the live testes had no problem understanding how to navigate away from the index-page. Two specifically said they liked the fact that both the pictures and the text were linked. The only surprise was that they thought perhaps the site would reload when pressing the blue Leonardo-L, however it did not.
                        On the remaining pages, the response was that it was easy to navigate because the navigation bar always was within reach and was similar on all of the pages.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Content</h3>
                        <p>Because we have not got the supposed information from our client, the text and image content is not very informative.
                        Therefore this paragraph will concentrate on wether the intended content is logically placed or not. 
                        In the questionnaire we asked how simple people thought it was to find the editor of Leonardo's magazine, and 85 percent answered they found it simple or very simple. The rest found it around average.
                        We asked the live test users to find Leonardo's history, which did not seem to be any problem. In other words, we conclude the over all content is good and logically placed although we miss the actual text.
                        When visiting the pages with subpages such as students and about Leonardo, we got comments on it being a bit confusing what content actually existed before scrolling down.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
                        <p>Because we have focused on making the website responsive to different formats and devices, it was importent to let the users test this as well.
                        According to the answers to the questionnaire, users liked the layout on both computer screens and when they opened the website on their phone. 
                        Especially, change the navigation bar into a hamburger menu, users commented on being a predictable and good transformation from a big to a small screen. 
                        The negative aspect, however, is that although all of the content fits on a phone screen and the layout is still nice, the pages becomes very long, end there will be a lot of scrolling.</p>

					<h2>Our response</h2>
					<p>
                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>We are absolutely aware there are a lot of improvements to implement designwise, otherwise as well. We should have had more iterations and more thorough user testing, however here are some specific things we could do:
                        That all of the slider does not show on a small computer screen could either be solved with responsiveness, or simply adjust the whole slider to be smaller. We could also design it differently with for example colors or images to make it more user friendly.
                        Another thing we believe would improve the user experience further is to implement more animation which would make the website more alive and fun. In a larger degree communicate the creativity that exist amongst the design students.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Navigation</h3>
                        <p>We should definitely have links on the students and about Leonardo pages that make the site scroll down to the correct location. Adding this, it would also make it more clear what to find on each of the sites once entering for example "students".
                        Because the Leonardo-L on all of the subpages is link to the index-page, we should perhaps make it a reload button on the index-page as well.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Content</h3>
                        <p>The number one potential for improvement is of course to have the right information and images, not only the correct headlines. This also applies for the wiki, which at this point have none but one example article. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
                        <p>Although the feedback was not too bad, there are things we would like to improve about the responsiveness. Firstly some parts are still a bit clumsy, you easily see that the elements were made for a computer, not a smartphone. Naturally, we want the elements to look tailored for every platform at all times. 
                        We also would like to make the responsiveness more fun instead of just adjusting text boxes and move images. This is definitely more time consuming than we could afford during this project, however we believe it would make the website pop. Again, the website is by and for design students, and should therefore do them justice. </p>

					<h2>Self-reflection</h2>
					<p>
                        <p>Firstly, we would like to mention that at least some of the group members have learned a lot HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Because we were two with experience and two without, it has been very important to cooperate and help each other during the project.
                        GitHub has been a great help and it has been very necessary because usually the group members have had different schedules and being able to work separately has been essential. This also helped the ones that did not feel like being super pro because it made it possible to see how the other group members did things.
                        As we all are design students, group projects are something we do a lot. I would say we did not have big issues when it came to working together. We meat once a week the whole group to work together and discuss things. One of the biggest struggles was actually to find one fixed time that all of us were able to meet. The only real "problem" was perhaps that one of us was not on the first meeting and did not 
                        join our shared GitHub-documents from the beginning. It turned out he was not that confortable sharing he's work-in-progress, however we had divided all of the pages between us, so it was not really a big issue after all. Moreover, we fixed it so that we all could see each other's work.<br>
                        We have had a lot of fun doing this project together, and we might have prioritized too much time on the actual website compared to these text-pages. All in all, we are very satisfied.</p>
