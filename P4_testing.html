                        <p>The purpose with this questionnaire was to get a brief feedback on Leonardo's new website. 
                        A few questions on who the answerers are and what they do to have an idea wether they are the intended user group for the website or not.
                        The rest of the questions should address wether the site is user friendly and functional. We asked the users to enter the website before answering the questions. 
                        The tasks they got are not the most thorough because we prioritized using a lot of time on the website itself, however we believe we believe we got valuable information that can help us improve the webpage.</p>

					<h2>Tester audience</h2>
					<p>
                        <p>To make sure the target audience answered the questionnaire, we asked our client, Leonardo linjeforening, to put it out on Leonardo linjeforening's private Facebook-page.
                        The group consists of current and former students at Industriell Design. We do want to have businesses and other students as our audience as well, however at this point we found it sufficient to concentrate on the main user group: students at Indusriell Design.
                        86 percent of the answerers were current students, the remaining 14 percent were former students, 11 percent employed, the rest uneployed. All of the answerers were between 18 and 40 years of age.
                        In addition we ran two live tests with students that did not study design. </p>

					<h2>Testing platforms</h2>
					<p>
                        <p>The majority of the respondents to the questionnaire said they used Google Chrome to visit the website. 17 percent used their smartphone, however we encouraged to try different devices, either by opening the link on their phone if they had not done it already, or simply resize the screen window on their computer.</p>

<!--Self-reflection: Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you learned
from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS
and JavaScript. We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful about your
comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us
or try to divine what we want to hear.-->
