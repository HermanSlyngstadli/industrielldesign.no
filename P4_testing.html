                        <p>The purpose with this questionnaire was to get a brief feedback on Leonardo's new website. 
                        A few questions on who the answerers are and what they do to have an idea wether they are the intended user group for the website or not.
                        The rest of the questions should address wether the site is user friendly and functional. We asked the users to enter the website before answering the questions. 
                        The tasks they got are not the most thorough because we prioritized using a lot of time on the website itself, however we believe we believe we got valuable information that can help us improve the webpage.</p>

					<h2>Tester audience</h2>
					<p>
<!--Tester Audience: A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the website's
intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of your tester audience
once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% college students, 46% school administrators,
etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges you can do the same. If you were able to do live testing
with a few users, describe that as well.-->
                        <p>To make sure the target audience answered the questionnaire, we asked our client, Leonardo linjeforening, to put the it out on Leonardo linjeforening's private Facebook-page.
                        The group consists of current and former students at Industriell Design. </p>
