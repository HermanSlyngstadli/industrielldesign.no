                            <p>This section should contain an introduction to the committee leaders as well as contact info. It should also have a description of the different committees. What they do, and how they contribute. Furthermore, we also want to include the history of Leonardo where students and alumni can read about Leonardo from its origins until today, milestones and achievements throughout the years. Maybe we can write down some tales and legends in the history part as well. About Leonardo’s overall goal is in other words to help new and seasoned students get an overview of how things work as well as who to contact if they need to. In other words, instead of using three different pages for “styre”-, “komité”- and “historie”-pages, we divide one page into three sections.</p>
